          We are two starting programers that happend to work in security industry and got some fresh ideas how to improve your household and overall safety
          <br /> Our vision is to ensure that all visitors and residents of your property are safe and sound.
          <br /> we identified the need to upgrade your standart home and property cameras to something more eficient and easy to deal with.
          
          <br /> 
          We decided to upgrade the cameras with strong face-recognition system connected to a database of all residents and guests.
          <br /> 
          Standart cameras are prity mutch boring and old-fashioned.
          <br /> The new system will allow us to address these challenges more
          professionally, ease our daily tasks, and enhance the quality of
          service we provide.
          New system will ensure you have no unwanted or unknown indeviduals on your property in simple and more eficient way.
